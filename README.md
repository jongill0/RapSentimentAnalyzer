# Rap Sentiment Analyzer
Twitter is a great way to gain insight into the minds of people, getting a glimpse of their thoughts, opinions, and feelings towards specific events and individuals. Recently, a public disagreement, or "beef," sparked between Drake and Pusha T, dividing the public on their music and revealing several surprising alleged facts. As a die-hard Drake fan, I wanted to try and analyze what people were saying on Twitter regarding the two rappers and recent events, gauging the overall sentiment towards the beef.

For this mini-project, I used Tweepy and TextBlob API to scrape tweets related to the beef between Drake and Pusha T, and performed sentiment analysis using TextBlob's NLP algorithms to determine an overall public outlook towards each rapper. I then graphed each of these figures to see which rapper was viewed in a more positive light, using this as a measure of overall public support. For comparison purposes, the sentiment analysis was performed on Kanye West, Kendrick Lamar, Lil Wayne, and Birdman. 

To actually view the tweets that were scraped in a systematic format, each rapper's specific tweets were written to a .csv file, along with a column indicating whether or not the tweet was "positive" or "negative." 

The results of the project are shown below for your amusement. Based on the results, Drake should eventually come out on top - hopefullt with a diss track that ends Pusha's career.
